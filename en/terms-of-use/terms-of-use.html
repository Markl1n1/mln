<li><strong>Indemnification: </strong>You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless each of the Protected Persons from and against any and all suits, losses, claims, demands, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) that arise from or relate to:  (a) your access to or use of the Website or any Content; (b) your breach of any provision of these Terms; (c) your violation of any applicable law, statute, ordinance, regulation or of any third party’s rights; or (d) any claim asserted by a third party which, if proven, would mean that you are in breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other provision of these Terms.</li>
<li><strong>Location of Your Access to the Website: </strong>We control and operate all of the Website from our offices in the United States of America and any access or use of any of the Website by you will be deemed to be at our offices in the United States.  We do not represent that the Website is appropriate or available for use in other locations.  Persons who choose to access any of the Website from other locations do so on their own initiative, and are responsible for compliance with local laws and regulations, if and to the extent local laws or regulations are applicable. The Website is not directed to any person in any jurisdiction where the publication or availability of any of the Website is prohibited, by reason of that person’s nationality, residence or otherwise. Persons subject to any such restriction must not access the Website.</li>
<li><strong>Contacting the Website: </strong>If you have any questions relating to the Website, or if you would like to submit a complaint or other report to us, please contact us at: <a href="mailto:contact@mln.finance">contact@mln.finance</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Governing Law: </strong>These Terms shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, U.S.A. without regard to its choice of law provisions.</li>
<li><strong>Arbitration: </strong>You and Millennium agree that any dispute that arises between us and you relating to any of the Website or these Terms that we and you cannot resolve informally will submitted to binding arbitration in the English language pursuant to the rules of the American Arbitration Association in the Borough of Manhattan, New York State.  Regarding the resolution of any dispute, you understand that:</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li><strong>Arbitration is final and binding</strong>.  <strong>By agreeing to arbitration, you waive your right to resolve disputes in court, including the right to a jury trial.  Arbitration is different from a court proceeding and is generally more limited.  The arbitrator’s decision is not required to include factual findings or legal reasoning.  Your right to appeal or seek to modify the arbitrator’s rulings is strictly limited.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Any questions about the nature of our relationship or the law surrounding this relationship will be governed by New York State law without giving effect to conflicts of law principles</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Additional Terms:  </strong>Certain pages or Content on or accessible through this Website may contain separate terms and conditions, which are in addition to these Terms. In the event of a conflict, the additional terms and conditions will govern such pages or Content, as the case may be.</li>
<li><strong>Miscellaneous:  </strong>By using the Website, you represent and warrant that you agree to abide by and that you are fully able and capable of complying with all of the terms, conditions, obligations, affirmations, representations and warranties set forth in these Terms.  Our rights and remedies and your representations, warranties and obligations herein shall be deemed cumulative, and any party’s exercise of any one of such party’s rights or remedies shall not preclude such party’s exercise of any other right or remedy then available to it (whether hereunder, another written, signed contract or at law or in equity).  Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. The Protected Persons are third party beneficiaries of these Terms.  Nothing in these Terms, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other person other than you, us or the Protected Persons any rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no provision herein shall be for the benefit of or enforceable by any of our or your creditors.  You shall not assign these Terms or delegate any of your obligations under these Terms.  Any purported assignment of these Terms in violation hereof is void.  The Terms constitute the entire understanding, and supersede all other understandings, between you and Millennium concerning the subject matter hereof.  If any provision of these Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms remain in full force and effect.  As used in these Terms, unless the context otherwise requires, (i) words in the singular number or in the plural number shall each include the singular number and the plural number, (ii) the use of any gender shall include all genders, (iii) “including” (and any of its derivative forms, e.g. “includes”) means including but not limited to, and (iv) “will”, “should”, “must” and “shall” are expressions of command, not merely expressions of future intent or expectation.</li>
