<p>In March 2023, we celebrated the opening of our new Tel Aviv office located within the Moshe Aviv Tower, in a premier location with close proximity to public transportation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The office has space for our growing presence in Israel. Millennium has been steadily building its presence in Israel since February 2019, when Millennium first launched its Quantitative Modeling group in the region. In addition to the Quantitative Modeling and Technology group, the Tel Aviv office has employees representing Risk Technology, Treasury Technology and GCP Engineering and Enablement.</p>



<p>To celebrate the opening, employees went on a culinary tour in the Levinsky market, tasting different foods and learning about the historical significance of different cultures that have immigrated to Israel. They also participated in a graffiti tour in the Florentine neighborhood, learning about graffiti/street art and the various techniques, tools and styles.&nbsp;</p>
