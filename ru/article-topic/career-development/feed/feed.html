        <h3>Given your experience across the intersection of finance and technology, what initially led you to Millennium?</h3>
        <p>I started my career on the sell-side, and while that experience was a great training ground, I wanted to leverage my skillset to make a greater impact. Millennium’s scale provides the opportunity to work on interesting challenges globally at the intersection of technology, math and finance.</p>

  
        <h3>How did your time at IIT Kharagpur prepare you for a career at Millennium?</h3>
        <p>I joined Millennium to help build the Commodities Quant Research team in India. Our team helps build the technology tools portfolio managers use to make informed decisions.</p>
<p>IIT Kharagpur provided me with a robust, multidisciplinary foundation in engineering, technology and mathematics. This multidisciplinary approach equipped me with the analytical skills and problem-solving mindset essential for tackling the complex challenges our team works on every day.</p>

  
        <h3>How has your time at Millennium been different than the other firms you’ve worked for? </h3>
        <p>One of the main differences is Millennium&#8217;s agility and approach to technology. Millennium provides access to cutting-edge technology, and gives us the ability to apply innovative techniques to challenges both new and old.</p>

  
        <h3>How has Millennium enabled you to continue to grow? </h3>
        <p>At Millennium, the range of opportunities and the ability to apply cutting-edge technology and innovative techniques creates a strong culture of continuous learning. There are always new opportunities to expand my skills, learn from my teammates, and make significant contributions in my domain.</p>

  
        <h3>What advice would you give to someone starting their career?</h3>
        <p>Embrace continuous learning, take initiative in your role and always stay committed to your goals.</p>

<p>In this feature, we spoke with Bimal Manak. Bimal started her career at Millennium in 2018 as an intern, and then transitioned to a full-time role as an Operations Analyst in London. Now, she is a Trade Support Specialist based in New York City. Read more on Bimal’s journey below.</p>


<section class="article-qna">
  
        <h3>What initially led you to Millennium? </h3>
        <p>During my time at university, I researched the industry and repeatedly came across Millennium as a strong firm. Initially, it was this reputation that drew me to the firm. I knew I would have the opportunity to learn from people with subject matter expertise in this field.</p>

  
        <h3>As a Trade Support Specialist, what does a day look like for you?</h3>
        <p>My role is constantly evolving. Each day is different as we work to maintain precise and efficient trade flows throughout the organization. As a result, my day-to-day involves partnering directly with various teams across the firm, including portfolio managers, business managers, risk managers, information technology and our external vendors.</p>

  
        <h3>You started at Millennium as an intern in 2018. After being at the firm for more than five years, what have been your biggest takeaways?</h3>
        <p>My biggest takeaway during my time at the firm has been that there is a widespread collegial culture and incredible talent across all areas of the business. Witnessing the firm&#8217;s expansion, transitioning through various roles and working alongside my colleagues has always been amazing.</p>

  
        <h3>You recently transitioned from Millennium’s London office to the New York City headquarters. How are you enjoying the change?</h3>
        <p>Transitioning to New York has been an incredibly rewarding experience, pushing me outside of my comfort zone in the best possible way. Moving countries was daunting at first, but getting to experience a new city has been great. I love being able to meet colleagues in person who I have worked with over the years, continuing to build these existing relationships while also creating new ones across the pond.</p>

  
        <h3>What has surprised you the most about your time here?</h3>
        <p>Before Millennium, I thought that working for a large, global firm meant that I would be siloed into a specific role in the business. I was quickly proven wrong! I have had the opportunity to work across various parts of the business and in various regions. Everyone I encounter is welcoming and willing to take time out of their day to help me; it makes working here so enriching.</p>

  
        <h3>What advice would you give to someone who is considering coming to work at Millennium?</h3>
        <p>At Millennium, there is no shortage of opportunity to work with subject-matter experts and to collaborate with a range of different teams. Do not be afraid to ask questions and reach out to people you’ve never met. You’ll be surprised by how willing everyone is to support you in your career and professional development—mentorship is integral to the Millennium experience.</p>

        <h3>What is your favorite part of your job? </h3>
        <p>Working as part of a team of talented, committed individuals who are trying to do the absolute best they can do every day.</p>

  
        <h3>What excites you about Millennium’s future? </h3>
        <p>I believe Millennium’s future is full of opportunity, and the exciting part is that everyone at the firm gets to contribute to writing that next chapter.</p>

  
        <h3>How do you know who is a good fit to work at Millennium? </h3>
        <p>Millennium values deep expertise, comprehensive knowledge and the ability to apply your experience. We also look for individuals who want to mentor our early career employees, and want to grow and develop at the firm.</p>

  
        <h3>What advice would you give your 22-year-old self? </h3>
        <p>There is no limit to what you can achieve if you’re focused and willing to work hard.</p>

  
        <h3>What is your favorite thing about New York City?</h3>
        <p>Working in New York City is great. The city has it all if you want to go out and explore. I love the sheer volume of interesting things to explore, including the great art, theater and food.</p>

  
        <h3>How do you find balance in your weeks? </h3>
        <p>I love absorbing the energy of the city and office all week, and on the weekend, I prioritize being active outside to bring that balance. In the winter, I ski, and in warmer weather, I play sports or   even just go for long walks in nature.</p>
