<p>Families at Millennium (FAM) is the firm’s newest employee network and is designed to support employees through all stages of caregiving, from current to future caregivers. FAM aims to create a culture of balance between work and family life through cultivating a community, increasing awareness of firm policies and resources and providing content through speakers, workshops, networking events and more.</p>



<p>Some of FAM’s recent events have included:</p>



<p>FAM hosted a First Aid CPR &amp; AED training course led by Shane Woodall, Founder and President of Frontline Health. The in-person and virtual course covered how to perform CPR, use an automated external defibrillator (AED) device and provide choking relief for adults and children.</p>



<p>FAM invited employees in the New York office to join a cooking class to learn recipes that are easy and fun to make with kids. A Registered Dietician led the class and taught the group healthy recipes. On the menu: sushi rolls and salad in a jar.</p>



<p>FAM joined with Millennium’s Multicultural Network to host a joint workshop focused on Raising Empathetic and Inclusive Children.&nbsp;The facilitator shared resources on how to raise compassionate children in a changing world, with a focus on combating racism, ableism and genderism.</p>



<p>FAM hosted a Networking Event so that caregivers could socialize with colleagues and learn more about the network and its initiatives.</p>

<p>In March 2023, we celebrated the opening of our new Tel Aviv office located within the Moshe Aviv Tower, in a premier location with close proximity to public transportation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The office has space for our growing presence in Israel. Millennium has been steadily building its presence in Israel since February 2019, when Millennium first launched its Quantitative Modeling group in the region. In addition to the Quantitative Modeling and Technology group, the Tel Aviv office has employees representing Risk Technology, Treasury Technology and GCP Engineering and Enablement.</p>



<p>To celebrate the opening, employees went on a culinary tour in the Levinsky market, tasting different foods and learning about the historical significance of different cultures that have immigrated to Israel. They also participated in a graffiti tour in the Florentine neighborhood, learning about graffiti/street art and the various techniques, tools and styles.&nbsp;</p>
