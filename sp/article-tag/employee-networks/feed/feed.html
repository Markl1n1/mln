<p>Families at Millennium (FAM) is the firm&rsquo;s newest employee network and is designed to support employees through all stages of caregiving, from current to future caregivers. FAM aims to create a culture of balance between work and family life through cultivating a community, increasing awareness of firm policies and resources and providing content through speakers, workshops, networking events and more.</p>



<p>Some of FAM&rsquo;s recent events have included:</p>



<p>FAM hosted a First Aid CPR &amp; AED training course led by Shane Woodall, Founder and President of Frontline Health. The in-person and virtual course covered how to perform CPR, use an automated external defibrillator (AED) device and provide choking relief for adults and children.</p>



<p>FAM invited employees in the New York office to join a cooking class to learn recipes that are easy and fun to make with kids. A Registered Dietician led the class and taught the group healthy recipes. On the menu: sushi rolls and salad in a jar.</p>



<p>FAM joined with Millennium&rsquo;s
 Multicultural Network to host a joint workshop focused on Raising Empathetic and Inclusive Children.&nbsp;The facilitator shared resources on how to raise compassionate children in a changing world, with a focus on combating racism, ableism and genderism.</p>



<p>FAM hosted a Networking Event so that caregivers could socialize with colleagues and learn more about the network and its initiatives.</p>

<p>MCN partnered with Apex for Youth to host a virtual story time event. Employees read children&rsquo;s books focused on the Lunar New Year.</p>



<p>To celebrate Black History Month, MCN hosted an immersive 360° national virtual tour traversing from the South to the North, delving into the profound and multifaceted history of African Americans in America.
