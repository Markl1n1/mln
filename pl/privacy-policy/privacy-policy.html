<h3><strong>Cookies and Related Technologies</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Information about our use of cookies</strong></h4>
<p>As you use our Website, and/or any Services, we collect certain information by automated or electronic means, using technologies such as cookies, browser analysis tools, and web server logs (“Website Usage Information”).</p>
<p>The Website Usage Information is stored in web server logs and also in web cookies kept on your computers or mobile devices, which are then transmitted back to us by your computers or mobile devices. These web servers are operated by, and the cookies are managed by, us, our business partners and/or our service providers. For example, when you access our Website and/or the Services, we and/or our service providers may place cookies on your computers or mobile devices. Cookies allow us to provide you with a good experience when you use our Website and/or Services and to recognize you when you return so you will not be required to register again to use our Website and/or Services. Cookies may also track your use of our Website and/or the Services and can help us to detect certain kinds of fraud.</p>
<p>By continuing to browse our Website and/or use our Services, you are agreeing to our use of cookies.</p>
<h4><strong>What are cookies?</strong></h4>
<p>A “cookie” is a small amount of information that a web server sends to your browser that stores information about your registration and your use of our Website and/or the Services. Some cookies contain numbers that allow us to connect our Website and/or the Services with other information we store about you in your profile or as related to your interactions with our Website and/or the Services. Some cookies are temporary, whereas others may be configured to last longer.</p>
<h4><strong>We do not use cookies that track activity off of our Website.</strong></h4>

<p>“Persistent” cookies are more cookies that are stored on your computers or mobile devices even after you exit your browser. For example, if you log into a portion of our Website that requires a log-in, the cookie may store login details and passwords so web users don’t need to re-enter them every time they use a site, and we and our service providers may use persistent cookies for a number of purposes, such as retrieving certain information you have previously provided and storing such information.</p>
